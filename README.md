# PITCHGEN

### a little practice patch which works with puredata and touchOSC

Feel free to download and use. Nothing fancy here yet – it's basically just a pitch pipe – but I hope to keep poking away at this, so check back for more features, maybe? If you feel like making a PR, go for it.

Features I'd like to add:
* Custom touchOSC layout (currently works with the first panel of Simple)
* Simple metronome with independent volume control
* Simple cent deviation
* Simple overtones / undertones
