# PITCHGEN

### a little practice patch which works with puredata and touchOSC
Feel free to download and use. Nothing fancy here yet – it's basically just a pitch pipe – but I hope to keep poking away at this, so check back for more features, maybe? If you feel like making a PR, go for it.

Features I'd like to add:
* Custom touchOSC layout (in progress in dev branch)
* Simple metronome with independent volume control
* Simple cent deviation (in progress in dev branch)
* Simple overtones / undertones

### NB
This patch is being developed using the [purr-data / Pd-L2Ork](https://git.purrdata.net/jwilkes/purr-data) distro of puredata, and I'm not testing in pd-extended or vanilla pd.
